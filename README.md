# Overview & possible clinical applications

This project builds a Supervised ML Image Classifier to detect pneumonia in paediatric X-ray images. In a hospital setting, the model can help highlight X-rays with pneumonia, which can be incorporated into clinical workflows to reduce human errors of missing abnormalities and highlight abnormal X-rays quickly to clinicians even before formal reports have been completed. In an outpatient setting, the ML tool can be used to find abnormal X-rays and push them up the priority for earlier reporting from the radiology team.

# Dataset

We used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data), which had 5,863 xray images which we used to train and test our model.

# Model & data processing
We built a Convoluted Neural Network(CNN) with 3 CNN layers and 2 Dense Layers. We used a variables
